# plotly-doc-viewer

> Standalone viewer + search for plotly.js docs [--> live viewer](http://rickyreusser.com/plotly-doc-viewer/)

## Development

Just clone it, then:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run export-schema
$ npm start
```

## To Do

- Set up the browsbabelerify whatnot in order to render the page to a string so it can just be rehydrated instead of render from scratch on load.
- Better searching
- Count up hits or something to more obviously bubble up how relevant stuff is
- UI fanciness
- Maybe use it for reals? Or just for my own use. TBD.

## License

Do anything you want with it
